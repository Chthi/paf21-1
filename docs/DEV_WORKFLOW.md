## Issues
- are supposed to be worked on within a single sprint (1-2 weeks of work time)

## Working on an Issue
1) create issue with description, specify what to do and add a *definition of done*
2) assign reviewer, put issue into a milestone, add labels, triage the issue
3) pull latest master changes (always commit into master)
4) implement the tests + feature, do red-green testing
5) pull latest master changes
6) run tests locally (only continue if all tests pass)
7) push all changes to the master branch

*Note: We'll try out an approach without feature branching. Let's see how it works.
<br>In case there are major issues with it, we'll be falling back to feature branching, etc.*

## Work Methodology
- pair programming -> automatic review, better quality
- changing team members -> spread the knowledge among the team
