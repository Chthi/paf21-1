## Issues
Are supposed to be worked on within a single sprint (1-2 weeks of work time)

## Working on an Issue
1) create issue with description, specify what to do and a little DoD
2) assign reviewer, put issue into a milestone, add labels
3) create a feature branch to work on (use numeric ids)
4) implement the tests + feature, do red-green testing
5) pull latest master changes
6) run tests locally (only continue if all tests pass)
7) push all changes to the master branch
