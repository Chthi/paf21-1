# Seminar Autonomous Driving (**P**raktikum **A**utonomes **F**ahren)

## About
This project is a competition-like challenge in the course Seminar Autonomous Driving
at the University of Augsburg.

Two teams of students (6-7 team members each) are creating their own self-driving car
software interacting with the CARLA simulation environment. At the end of the project,
there will be a live demo including a city and a racing mode where the cars of both
teams compete against each other.

The live demo will include the interaction with other cars / pedestrians, traffic lights.
Moreover there will be driving tests on a variety of maps to ensure that the self-driving
is not bound to a single map that was learnt by heart.
