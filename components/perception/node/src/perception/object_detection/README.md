# Object Detection

## Detection Techiques

**Procedure Sketch:**

1) Observe objects using the segmentation camera
2) Put bounding boxes around the objects
3) Cluster the boxes of several timesteps (-> detect movement)
4) Predict the movement direction and speed

**TODO: Johannes / Josh:**
- add more details on the actual implementation
- outline the reasons for specific design decisions (which algorithms were tried out + pros/cons)
