# fix
# TypeError: Descriptors cannot not be created directly.
# If this call came from a _pb2.py file, your generated code is out of date and must be regenerated with protoc >= 3.19.0.
# If you cannot immediately regenerate your protos, some other possible workarounds are:
#  1. Downgrade the protobuf package to 3.20.x or lower.
#  2. Set PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python (but this will use pure-Python parsing and will be much slower).
